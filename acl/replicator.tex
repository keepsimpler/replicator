  The replicator equations illustrate the evolution of the distribution of types in a population. We utilize replicator dynamics as the backbone to create an architecture, Replicator, which directly learns discrete probability distributions over feature spaces. Replicator could apply whenever needing to learn probability distributions. In Replicator, data features first transform into discrete distributions over a probability space. After that, the discrete distributions evolve according to the replicator equation rules. Finally, the discrete distributions are converted back to the original data space. Replicator achieved the-state-of-art accuracy and performance in both synthetic and realistic datasets.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Approach}

% Language modeling is usually framed as unsupervised distribution estimation for a set of 

Given a sequence of words $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T)$, the goal of a language model is to estimate the joint probability of the sequence:
\begin{equation}
  P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T).
\end{equation}
Since language has a sequential ordering, it is common to factorize the joint probability of the sequence as the product of conditional probabilities:
\begin{equation}
  P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_T) = \prod_{t=1}^n P(x_t \vert x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1}).
\end{equation}

Thus, the efficient modeling of conditional probabilities of the next
word given all the previous ones, $P(x_t \vert x_1, \ldots, x_{t-1})$,
is critical for the capability of the language model.

Although the neural models computing these conditional probabilities have improved their expressiveness significantly, such as self-attention architectures like the Transformer \cite{vaswani2017attention}, they all have one limitation.

We here first using replicator dynamics to directly model the conditional probabilities.

\subsection{Replicator Equation}
In the field of evolutionary game theory, the replicator equation is defined as follows. Let $x_i$ is the proportion of type $i$ in the population, $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is the vector of the distribution of types in the population, and $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1$. The continuous form of replicator equation can be written in the form:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{x_i} = x_i \left((Ax)_i - x^T A x \right) ,
\end{equation}
where the payoff matrix $A$ holds all the fitness information for the population: the fitness of type $i$ is $(Ax)_i$ and the average fitness of the population is $x^T A x$.

Similar to the continuous form, the discrete form of the replicator equation can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  x_i^{'} = x_i + x_i \left[ (Ax)_i - x^T A x \right] .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Bayesian Inference}


\subsection{Bayesian Inference is a special case of Replicator Equation}


\cite{harper2009replicator}

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Replicator is the first language model relying entirely on the replicator equation to compute the conditional probabilities over the words.

\section{Model Architecture}

Our model does not require position embeddings because the token-mixing Replicator Layer are sensitive to the order of the input tokens. %such information will be captured in $P$

Spatial information acros√üs tokens (words), which position the words should be. 

Our model accepts a word sequence, linearly embeds each word to a feature vector, and obtain a 2-rank tensor with shape (words $\times$ features) as input. Replicator network (architecture) makes use of two types of Replicator layers: word Replicators and feature Replicators. The word Replicators capture co-occurrences patterns among words in the sequence. They operate on each feature independently and take individual columns as inputs. The feature Replicators allow communication between different features.

\section{Why Replicator}
Dynamic directly in probability space, has no vanishing / exploding gradient problems, thus no normal layer is required.

\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation: 
\begin{quote}
\tt\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
\end{quote}
This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

\subsection{References}

\nocite{vaswani2017attention}

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly follow the American Psychological Association format.
If your own bib file is named \texttt{custom.bib}, then placing the following before any appendices in your \LaTeX{} file will generate the references section for you:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
\bibliography{custom}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

You can obtain the complete ACL Anthology as a Bib\TeX{} file from \url{https://aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib.gz}.
To include both the Anthology and your own .bib file, use the following instead of the above.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
\bibliography{anthology,custom}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Please see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex} for information on preparing Bib\TeX{} files.

\subsection{Appendices}

Use \verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} for an example.

\section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
\label{sec:bibtex}

Unicode cannot be used in Bib\TeX{} entries, and some ways of typing special characters can disrupt Bib\TeX's alphabetization. The recommended way of typing special characters is shown in Table~\ref{tab:accents}.

Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible, and for all the ACL materials that you reference.
Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.
